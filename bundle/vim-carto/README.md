# Vim Carto

This was copied from the main carto project for use in a Vundle-using Vim
setup. If there is an update by the main carto developers for this syntax and
I haven't gotten around to updating this, please send a pull request. I am not
a GIS junkie and I really only needed this for my encounter with TileMill so
I would really appreciate that. Thanks!
